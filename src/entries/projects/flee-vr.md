Flee VR was a test scene for the VR portion of an animated documentary. Built in Unreal Engine, the test allowed for exploration of different techniques to create atmosphere and tension for a short VR experience. As lead developer for this project I created tools to allow the artists to paint backgrounds seamlessly, designed particle effects, contributed to the 3D assets, and worked on the general assembly of the scene.
