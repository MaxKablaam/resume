For this project I learned how to use medical imaging and scientific data analysis software in order to extract 3D models from my friend and frequent collaborator [Justin Wright](https://www.justinwright.ca/)'s CT scans. Using the new Geometry Nodes features in Blender, I was able to create an animation using his medical data.
