This non-profit gallery is a pillar of the local arts scene in Montreal. It’s widely known in the community for its biweekly life-drawing evenings and exhibitions spotlighting emerging talent. My volunteering involves hands-on support with art installations and providing technical expertise for various events and displays. Whether it’s setting up lighting, audio-visual equipment, or assisting with any other technical aspects of exhibits, I’m glad to help out at a place that is so vital to the local art scene.
