Guided by a [friend](https://evanmontpellier.net/)'s recommendation, I discovered a vibrant non-profit makerspace in Montrealâ€™s Chabanel garment district. Embracing this opportunity, I now work and create within this inspiring studio space. I find myself surrounded by an exceptionally talented and thoughtful group of artists and makers that give so much to the arts community in Montreal. I feel like I should contribute back in whatever way I can. The Communications Committee is responsible for developing and managing the internal communication systems, ensuring effective collaboration across the organisation.
