- I have a deep interest in the science and art of holography. Over the summer of 2017, I attended the [Pulse Laser Holography Workshop](https://holocenter.org/programs/pulse-laser-holography-workshop), in Columbus, OH, where I learned how to create true laser holograms. No "Pepper's Ghost" illusions here. I am amassing a collection of holograms that I'm slowly purchasing off ebay.
- From 2006-2012, I was a core member of the band [Sweet Mother Logic](https://sweetmotherlogic.bandcamp.com/track/natural-history). We released three albums.
- I taught myself coding.
- I took jazz piano lessons for seven years.
- I worked as a bartender in an Irish pub in Paris. Despite no accent, I was constantly being asked if I was Irish.
- I've been admitted to hospitals in at least 5 countries. Am I prone to injury, or do I just travel *that* much? The answer is, actually, that I have a peanut allergy.
