I am an Art & Tech Director with over 12 years of experience in the animation and interactive media industries. I like to make stuff, and help other people make stuff, too. My career has encompassed a wide range of projects, each shifting my focus and expanding my expertise. My current focus is on interdisciplnary research to bridge technology and creative practice. I'm seeking new opportunities that challenge and utilize my diverse skill set.
