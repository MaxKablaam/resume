title: About Me
---

I am an Art & Tech Director with over 12 years of experience in the animation and interactive media industries. I like to make stuff, and help other people make stuff, too. My current focus is on interdisciplinary research to bridge technology and creative practice. I'm currently seeking new challenges and opportunities.
