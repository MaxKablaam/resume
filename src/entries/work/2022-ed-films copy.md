As the Lead Art & Tech Director at E.D. Films, I was responsible for project based leadership, including organising and delegating, as well as designing, prototyping, coding software tools. I was also responsible for technical and creative aspects related to film project needs, including animation, compositing, VFX, and rigging. My experience would be called upon to determine the technical impact of the artistic vision. I would frequently develop best practices, solutions and tools, as well as undertake research to solve challenges.

I was also responsible for maintaining the rendering pipeline, a critical system that I helped to establish and enhance during my tenure. Additionally, I served as an IT liaison and network administrator.
