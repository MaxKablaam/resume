After a short period doing freelance work for E.D. Films, they enjoyed working with me so much they offered me a full-time position. I graciously accepted, as they were my favourite client. My list of responsibilities included animation (2D & 3D), technical direction, tutorial creation (for their once-active YouTube channel), research, pipeline development, digital tool design, and scripting/coding.

While in this position I also began developing the studio infrastructure to be better equipped for bigger and more challenging projects.
