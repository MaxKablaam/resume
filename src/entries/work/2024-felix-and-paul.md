At the renowned Felix & Paul Studios, I worked as a Senior Technical Artist. During this time, I contributed to a top-secret VR project, creating assets in Unreal Engine with a focus on the Niagara particle system. My tenure at Felix and Paul Studios was brief, as I was accepted into graduate school at CalArts and chose to pursue that opportunity.
